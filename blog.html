                    <h3>Dubrovnik</h3>
                    <p>Dubrovnik was the more expensive of the Croatian coastal towns 
                        and definitely the one with the most touristy vibe. The hotel 
                        we stayed in was also the 4-star-iest of all. The view was excellent
                        and we did watch an old-timey merchant ship replica sail off 
                        into the sunset. We were assured by the locals that the water would
                        be a freezing 25 degrees Celcius due to it being October. As stoic
                        Vancouverites, we went in anyway and it was refreshing.

                    <h3>Split</h3>
                    <p>Split felt like a rougher town. Lot's of graffity and trash in the streets.
                        We did a walking tour of the Old Town as we did in every city we could, hosted
                        by Free Spirit Walking Tours. Our guide Tina was excellent and very forgiving
                        of our tardiness (we were 10-15 minutes late eek!). She informed us that the best way
                        to prevent your business or home form being vandalized was to paint a mural of
                        the local soccer team. It was like a religion and if any one vandalized that mural
                        they would (allegedly) be in for a beating... Overall it feels a good mix of trendy and traditional and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for relatively safe and affordable place to explore and meet people. 
                        We still have 8 more days in Croatia where we will slowly be driving down the coast so I'll keep you all updated! 8/10

                    <h3>London</h3>
                    <p>London visits were a key childhood memory. I regualrly visited and stayed with my grandparents in Camden Town up until about 2018 when they moved
                        out to East Finchley to get away from the traffic and noise. It's very nice to be back a spending time with my mum and Grandad. This time my
                        partner has joined and we are heading to Croatia together after this. 
                        This is my partner's first time really exploring London so naturally he wanted to hit the touristy spots such as Buckingham Palace, Tower Bridge, London Eye etc while walking along the Thames.
                        These places are, of course, crushingly busy and mostly consist of looking at, admiring or walking by cool looking stuff with throngs off others trying to do the same.

                    <h3>Camden</h3>
                    <p>Walking around Camden (pictured), East Finchley, Borough Market and the RAF Museum in Edgeware on the otherhand was very quiet and pleasent (not including Camden Market on the quiet front
                        but a fun stop to check out!). Camden is very nostalgic, East Finchley is a quiet but interesting suburb, Borough Market is a new. hip food and wares semi-open roofed market worth 
                        seeing. The <a href="https://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/">RAF Museum</a> was a nice break on a rainy day and AWESOME if you like planes (free entry, starting from WW1 to present). 10/10</p>
